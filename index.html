            <p>
                Hello and welcome! My name is Nitza Rondon-Rosario and I am enrolled in CWRU's Web Development Boot Camp. I work at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland where my responsibilities include the administration, maintenance, and support of my department's SharePoint environment. This also includes the development of the department's new site collection as well as training and coaching end users.
            </p>

            <!-- Consider coming to one of AH's events to learn more about what they do and offer to the community! -->
            <p>
                When I am not engrossed in all things SharePoint, I am usually spending time with my husband and two sons, ages 16 and 12. In addition to kid activities I am on the Board of Directors of <a href="http://www.arthouseinc.org/" target="_blank">Art House, Inc.</a>, a small local non-profit art organization, where our goal is to enrich the lives of those who live in our community, to encourage and strengthen the careers of local artists and to promote learning through the arts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <!-- Consider becoming a mentor yourself! -->
            <p>
                I am a mentor at <a href="http://www.esperanzainc.org/" target="_blank">Esperanza, Inc.</a> specifically with the ELLA (Esperanza's Latina Leadership Alliance) program that is gender specific [males: ELLOS (Esperanza's Latino Leaders for an Outstanding Society)] that provides an opportunity to bring together adult leaders to predominantly Hispanic high school youth. The purpose of both of these groups is to provide teenagers with leadership and educational resources. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I'm also a member of the Cleveland Municipal School District Nominating Panel which is charged with nominating a slate of persons for the Mayor to make appointments for each Board of Education vacancy. In my spare time I love to read so I hardly watch any TV, but when I do you can usually find me binge watching Bizarre Foods or being forced to watch some survival/car show. Â
